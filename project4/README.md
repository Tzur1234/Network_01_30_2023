# Network

__Design a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.__

> Used languages:  Python(Django), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

I have used Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in order to create a social network app  (based on the Django framework) that allows users to make posts, follow other users, and “like” posts.

I have learned alot about: 
1. How connect between the backend and the frontend , using fetch API and develop my own route receiving the request

2. How to work with models and a variety of fields' types and field's option

3. How to work with Paginator class and implement it in the Frontend part

4. Using JavaScript to asynchronously let the server know to update the any field from the DB (as via a call to fetch) and then update the displayed in the user side on the page, without requiring a reload of the entire page.

5. Expand my knowledge about JS, and how to use dataset attribute, how to call API, how to dynamically change the DOM
* Event Listeners & The Event Object
* Event Bubbling & Delegation
* Removing & Replacing Elements

6. Expand my knowledge about how to use bootstrap more effectively
